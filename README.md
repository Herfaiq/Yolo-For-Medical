# YOLOv8: Introduction to Object Detection, Classification, and Segmentation

Welcome to our Computer Vision project where we explore YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art algorithm for object detection, classification, and segmentation. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is renowned for its efficiency and accuracy, enabling real-time object detection in a single pass. üéØ

## Project Overview üåü

This project delves into the capabilities of YOLOv8, leveraging its versatility and advanced features for various computer vision tasks.

### Why YOLOv8?
YOLOv8 is not only efficient for object detection but also provides robust support for:
- **Classification:** Categorizing objects into predefined classes.
- **Detection:** Identifying objects and their locations in images.
- **Segmentation:** Precisely outlining objects in an image.

This makes YOLOv8 an excellent tool for a wide range of computer vision applications, including medical imaging, where detecting and classifying anomalies and diseases is critical.

## Applications Explored ‚ú®

In this project, we focus on the following three major tasks using YOLOv8:
1. **Classification**
2. **Detection**
3. **Segmentation**

### Case Study: Medical Imaging
We apply YOLOv8 in the field of medical imaging to:
- Detect anomalies in diagnostic images.
- Classify medical conditions.
- Segment regions of interest in medical scans.
